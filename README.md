# RTS_Game

Game developed using Unity and ML-agents to create an AI that could play a Basic RTS game. the orginal RTS game was adapted from Zenva (https://academy.zenva.com/product/real-time-strategy-project-enemy-ai/). 

What i did was create update the AI to do include more behaviours, then using the basic FSM i designed and trained a nueral networked AI to compete against the FSM to see what works best.
